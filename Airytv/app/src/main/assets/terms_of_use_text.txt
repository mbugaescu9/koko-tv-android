<br/><br/>16.Dispute Resolution Provisions.   The Agreement shall be treated as though it were executed and performed in Palo Alto, California and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California (without regard to conflict of law principles).   Should a dispute arise concerning the Showfer Media Offerings, the terms and conditions of the Agreement or the breach of same by any party hereto: (a) the parties agree to submit their dispute for resolution by arbitration before a reputable arbitration organization as mutually agreed upon by the parties; and (b) each End-User agrees to first commence a formal dispute proceeding by completing and submitting an Initial Dispute Notice which can be found Here. We may choose to provide petitioning End-Users with a final written settlement offer after receiving such End-User’s Initial Dispute Notice (“Final Settlement Offer”). If we provide a petitioning End-User with a Final Settlement Offer and that End-User does not accept it, or we cannot otherwise satisfactorily resolve that End-User’s dispute and that End-User wishes to proceed, that End-User must submit its dispute for resolution by arbitration before a reputable arbitration organization as mutually agreed upon by the parties, in that End-User’s county of residence, by filing a separate Demand for Arbitration, which is available Here. If the arbitrator awards an End-User relief that is greater than our Final Settlement Offer, then we will pay all filing, administration and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration and, if that End-User retained an attorney to represent it in connection with the arbitration, we will reimburse any reasonable attorneys’ fees that such End-User’s attorney accrued for investigating, preparing and pursuing the claim in arbitration. Any award rendered shall be final and conclusive to the parties and a judgment thereon may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to preclude any party from: (i) seeking injunctive relief in order to protect its rights pending an outcome in arbitration; and/or (ii) pursuing the matter in small claims court rather than arbitration. Although we may have a right to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses if we prevail in arbitration, we will not seek such an award from any End-User unless the arbitrator determines that such End-User’s claim was frivolous.
<br/><br/>To the extent permitted by law, each End-User agrees that it will not bring, join or participate in any class action lawsuit as to any claim, dispute or controversy that it may have against Showfer Media and/or its employees, officers, directors, members, representatives and/or assigns. Each End-User agrees to the entry of injunctive relief to stop such a lawsuit or to remove it as a participant in the suit. Each End-User agrees to pay the attorney’s fees and court costs that Showfer Media incurs in seeking such relief. This provision preventing End-Users from bringing, joining or participating in class action lawsuits: (A) does not constitute a waiver of any End-User’s rights or remedies to pursue a claim individually and not as a class action in binding arbitration as provided above; and (B) is an independent agreement. Any End-User may opt-out of these dispute resolution provisions by providing written notice of her/his decision within thirty (30) days of the date that it first accesses the Service.
<br/><br/>17.Miscellaneous.   To the extent that anything in or associated with the Showfer Media Offerings is in conflict or inconsistent with the Agreement, the Agreement shall take precedence. Showfer Media’s failure to enforce any provision of the Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of such provision nor of the right to enforce such provision. The parties do not intend that any agency or partnership relationship be created through operation of the Agreement. Should any part of the Agreement be held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed consistent with applicable law and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect. Showfer Media may assign its rights and obligations under the Agreement, in whole or in part, to any party at any time without notice to you. The Agreement may not, however, be assigned by you, and you may not delegate your duties under it. Headings are for reference purposes only and in no way define, limit, construe or describe the scope or extent of such section.
