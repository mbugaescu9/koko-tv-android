        Here\'s how it works - you click ENTER and you\'ll have to watch an ad
        (we know ads suck but it helps pay the bills).
        Then when the ad is done THAT’S IT.
        You can enter as many times as you like, more entries = more chances to win.
        The more entries we get, the higher the prizes we can offer.
        <br/>

        FAQ
        <br/><b>How do you enter a giveaway?</b>
        <br/>Here’s the great part there is NO PURCHASE NECESSARY to enter or win a giveaway.  You can also enter as many times as is allowed.  Simple click the “Enter” button and it is that easy.

        <br/>Our giveaways are only available to individuals that are legal residents of, and living in the United States, who are eighteen (18) years of age or older and can enter into a legally binding contract under applicable law.
        <br/><br/><b>How do I Win?</b>
        <br/>Well winning is the easy part.  We randomly choose one (1) winner based on the entries within five (5) days after the end date/time of a giveaway.  The prize winner is then notified based upon the login or information they provided as part of account creation.  Email or electronic delivery notification will be used.  All prize winners are subject to eligibility verification.
        <br/><br/><b>Limit on Entries</b>
        <br/>Entries are sometimes limited and are automatically updated daily.  Each giveaway will provide you with a counter on the entry which will tell you how many times you may enter per day.  Once the counter has fulfilled your entries for that day you will have to come back the next day to receive more entries.
        <br/><br/><b>Copyright Information</b>
        <br/>All pictures used within the application are free license photos.
        <br/><br/><b>Do I have to pay taxes on my winnings?</b>
        <br/>Any giveaway that exceeds $600 will be reported on a W-9 and 1099-Misc as required by state law.  Those users who have a single win in excess of this amount will be required to provide a SSN in order to obtain their winnings. If you have any further questions about taxes you will need to refer to your accountant or tax professional.
